# GoodNight 💤

### GoodNight is a program that allows you to set a timer for your device, similar to sleep timer functions in Smart TVs. 

## TO-DO 🎯
### -  1 : shutdown function - ✔️
### -  2 : cancel funciton - ✔️
### -  3 : sleep/hibernate function - ✔️
### -  4 : temp file to check if there is currently a running action - ✔️  
### -  5 : Time suggestion buttons (+- 1 min,+- 10 min, +- 30 min) - ✔️

## Tips and tricks (for now):
### 1. You can type directly the time that you want to set, instead of using the buttons.
### 2. If you put zero seconds, it will sleep/hibernate in 10 seconds.
### 3. If you just started again your device, and it appears that an action is currently running, just clear the actions and you will be able to use it again.


## Future
### HUD alterations will be made in the future. But, currently, I am satisfied with a dark-themed program. It will very probably be implemented in atleast another language other than english, such as portuguese and spanish.
