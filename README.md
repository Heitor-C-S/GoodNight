# GoodNight 💤

### GoodNight is a small program aimed to facilitate shutting down with a timer your computer without the need to open a terminal. 

## TO-DO 🎯
### -  1 : shutdown function - ✔️
### -  2 : cancel funciton - ✔️
### -  3 : sleep/hibernate function - ✔️
### -  4 : temp file to check if there is currently a running action - ✔️  

## Future
### HUD alterations will be made in the future. But, currently, I am satisfied with a dark-themed program. It will very probably be implemented in atleast another language other than english, such as portuguese and spanish.
